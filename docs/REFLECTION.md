# Reflection

Answer each question in 2-3 sentences.

## Most surprising discovery

Which vulnerability surprised you the most to find? Why didn't you expect it?

The secret in history vulnerability surprised me the most because I likely wouldnt have found it without Agent's help. It was buried so deep in the history that I can see how it can easily be disregarded and forgotten.

## Real-world risk

Pick one vulnerability you found. How would you explain its danger to a teammate who's never heard of it?

I would explain the danger of XSS to a friend by saying... this vulnerability gives others the ability to run code on your website without your permission. This can result in very malicious executions that can be avoided with careful attention and practice.

## Future practice

What specific habit or check will you add to your own coding workflow to catch these issues before they ship?

I will definilty always check for the hardcoded secrets vulnerability in my own coding workflow. I would not want someone to get that information and then have to go on a wild goose hunt to shut things down and stay protected.
